                            <p>
                                Initially all I knew is I wanted to do a <span class="Span3">historically based site</span>. After a bit of research, I decided to <span class="Span3">style it like a book</span> running in a linear fashion from left to right and channelling the flow. <span class="Span3">I didn’t do a header</span> because I wanted to naturally incorporate the flow like a person reading a book and flipping pages. I also wanted to let the user have the option to skip chapters or navigate between then which is why I added the navigation bar to let them do that. I wanted to make a clear blue “airflow” bar modern on top of old but in the end, <span class="Span3">I ended up making the “Shadow bar” like a shadow on an old book</span>. I started meddling with mobile design for it and the whole site as visible in the body but that didn’t get far as I didn’t have the time for it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I decided to start by creating self-containing elements and keep stylesheets separated in order to keep the project manageable. <span class="Span3">My idea was to reuse elements</span> and change them according to the specific need of the page. Rather than an overall site design I started building the elements first and then seeing how they fit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first Idea I had was to build glass panels and overlay them on top of old medieval images, however that didn’t work very well as I wasn’t able to find the right texture. After experimenting a little I found out that <span class="Span3">a good cloud texture I found works very well</span> on some pages I left its position fixed and the clouds are literally moving on scroll. That worked out and then I just <span class="Span3">simplified the cloud panels and made some parchment or paper panels from that</span>. The two panels look very different but are in fact along with <span class="Span3">all the other elements essentially the same thing. A div inside a div inside a div ext. with animations manipulating its parts and positioning it inside a grid</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="Span3">I didn’t want to overwhelm the user with information</span> though which is why I decided to make the site more <span class="Span3">animated like a comic book</span> or a graphic novel. While I was <span class="Span3">learning from w3school CSS lessons I encountered a lesson about flipping images</span> and that inspired me to play around I wanted to make cards or pages flip with CSS only animations as I thought that would be a more engaging way of storytelling rather than overwhelming them with information. <span class="Span3">A made a simple zooming card and a more complicated flipping one but essentially all the elements are the same although they don’t look like it.</span>
                                After the flip-cards I played around with the transform origin property and found out that the flip can be manipulated from left to right and depending on the Y, Z and X axis the <span class="Span3">cards can flip like a page</span>. After that I decided to add a few div behind paly around with the transform3d and I was able to make a book which was perfect for a bibliography. Although perhaps not as functional as a scrolling list in my opining at least it’s a very effective way of storytelling.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="Span3">From the books came the windows</span>, I decided to experiment with one of the books copied 2 covers expanded a div twice the width and used the same rotate property. Moved one of the covers by 50% to the right changed its transform origin to the right side replaced the paper with an image and voila. The wooden and glass window are the same but with a different texture. The Glass texture came from my previous attempts with the glass panel and after reducing the opacity and giving it the minimum possible blur, I was surprised how good it looked. <span class="Span3">The glass panels never materialised but the window looks good</span> (apart from my Head Pic).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, the Buttons were born out of necessity I needed a button class, but I couldn’t think of anything better or interesting I could do so I used them. I wanted something better and I did have more ideas for my site but unfortunately, I run out if time and I wasn’t able to accomplish all of them. I chose the bright green colour as its my favourite colour and the rest of the team wasn’t too colourful in that specific range.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I started <span class="Span3">experimenting with both flexbox and CSS grid</span> which is why although the page layout says CSS Grid, I do tend to use both. I added shadows to almost all my elements as I noticed that made a huge difference. <span class="Span3">Without the shadows</span> the whole site looks like a flat canvas without much life but with them especially on the moving elements <span class="Span3">they almost look real in some places</span>. The Images are all from <span class="Span3">Wikimedia Commons, Pixabay and a few other sites free licences</span> all were resized and/or optimised with the website https://compressimage.toolur.com/ as most needed custom fitting and or optimisation. I tried to make the site <span class="Span3">as user friendly for navigation as possible</span> although most images are not in html but instead in CSS as I wanted to focus more on that part of the assignment I wanted to experiment and <span class="Span3">use CSS as much as possible if I could over HTML</span>. Although both are used together in harmony the latest part of our semester covered CSS which is why I wanted to practice it as much as I can.
